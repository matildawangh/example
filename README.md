## APPROACH

* Bin the 'age'. Do histogram first to see distribution. And then encode it.
* Proposed bin size
* 0 -18
* 19 - 30
* 30 - 50
* 50 - 65
* 65 - 72
* 72 - 80
* Some nulls in BMI (two datasets 1. null dropped, 2. null replaced with some value - mean is good 28.1)
* 1544 Unknown Smokers. What do we do? Can we put negative one.
